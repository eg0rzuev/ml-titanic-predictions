# Titanic passengers and crew survival classification

This project utilizes the Titanic dataset from the R
language package ’stablelearner’, which contains information
about passengers and crew members, including their age, sex,
class, fare, and survival status. By leveraging different Machine
Learning techniques such as K nearest neighbours, logistic
regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting,
and MLP, the project aims to build accurate models that can
classify passengers into survivors and non-survivors.
